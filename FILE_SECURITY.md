# File Security Implementation

## Overview

This application now implements a secure file access system that hides direct UFS URLs from users and provides presigned URLs only to file owners.

## Security Features

### 1. Hidden UFS URLs
- Direct UFS URLs are never exposed to users in the frontend
- All file access goes through authenticated API endpoints
- Only file owners can access their files

### 2. Presigned URLs for File Access
- Temporary presigned URLs are generated on-demand
- URLs expire after 1 hour for security
- Each request verifies file ownership before generating URLs

### 3. Protected File Operations
- **View**: Generates presigned URL and opens in new tab
- **Download**: Uses presigned URL for secure download
- **Delete**: Requires ownership verification

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoint: `/api/files/[fileId]`

#### GET - Generate Presigned URL
- **Authentication**: Requires valid Auth0 session
- **Authorization**: User must own the file
- **Response**: Returns presigned URL with metadata
- **Expiration**: URLs expire in 1 hour (3600 seconds)

```typescript
{
  presignedUrl: string,
  expiresIn: number,
  fileName: string,
  fileSize: number,
  contentType: string
}
```

#### DELETE - Remove File
- **Authentication**: Requires valid Auth0 session  
- **Authorization**: User must own the file
- **Action**: Removes file record from database

### Frontend Components

#### FileCard Component
- Fetches presigned URLs on-demand for view/download
- Shows loading states during URL generation
- Caches presigned URLs to avoid repeated requests

#### Upload Page
- Uses presigned URLs for viewing recently uploaded files
- Removes direct URL copying functionality
- Provides secure file access buttons

### Security Benefits

1. **Database Security**: Even if the database is compromised, direct file URLs aren't exposed to unauthorized users
2. **Temporary Access**: Presigned URLs expire automatically, limiting access window
3. **Ownership Verification**: Every file access request verifies user ownership
4. **Audit Trail**: All file access requests are logged server-side

## Configuration

The implementation uses UploadThing's `generateSignedURL` API with:
- **Expiration**: 1 hour (configurable)
- **Authentication**: Server-side token verification
- **Authorization**: File ownership validation

## Usage Examples

### Viewing a File (Frontend)
```typescript
const handleView = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/files/${fileId}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  window.open(data.presignedUrl, '_blank');
};
```

### Downloading a File (Frontend)
```typescript
const handleDownload = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/files/${fileId}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  const link = document.createElement('a');
  link.href = data.presignedUrl;
  link.download = data.fileName;
  link.click();
};
```

This implementation ensures that users can only access files they own, while providing a seamless user experience for legitimate file operations.
